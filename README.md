## Machine Learning Project - Flask Application

Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end machine learning pipeline implemented using modular coding techniques. The pipeline includes data ingestion, data transformation, and model training with hyperparameter tuning. The trained model is then deployed using Flask, allowing users to interact with it via a web interface.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main modules:

**Data Ingestion**: In this module, we collect and load the dataset into the project. The dataset serves as the foundation for our machine learning tasks.

**Data Transformation**: This module handles data preprocessing and feature engineering. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and any other necessary transformations.

**Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Here, we build and train machine learning models on the transformed data. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. We explore various algorithms and select the best-performing one.

**Flask Deployment**: The trained model is deployed using Flask, creating a web interface where users can input data and receive predictions.

**Artifacts**: This directory contains saved model files and any preprocessed data objects that are needed for predictions during deployment.

**src**: This directory holds the source code for the project, including the Python scripts and modules.


Certainly! Here's a template for a README file for your machine learning project deployed on Flask, covering data ingestion, data transformation, and model training with hyperparameter tuning:

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
To loaddata, transform data and train the model 
    'python dataingestion.py'
Install the required dependencies:
    'pip install -r requirements.txt'
Run the Flask web application:
    'python app.py'
The web application should now be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.
